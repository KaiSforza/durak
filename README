Dev setup guide:
 - Make sure that you have Node.JS Installed
    - I recommend using NVM (Node Version Manager) then using that to install Node on a per project basis. The windows version can be found here: https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows
 - Run "npm install" in the terminal, this will install all of the packages needed to run the project (and all of their dependencies)

Running the application:
 - You should have completed the dev setup (install Node and all dependencies)
 - in the project directory run "npx tsc" this will compile the typescript in .\src
 - run "npm start" to run the application

 Quick Guide:
  - Install Node
  - Run the following commands in the project directory:
    > npm install
    > npx tsc
    > npm start
