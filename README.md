This project is a playable version of the card game, Durak ('fool' in Russian). 

The game can be played with up to 5 people, with a deck of 36 cards (6 through Ace, Ace high).

See the [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durak) for more information.

Dev setup guide:
 - Make sure that you have Node.JS Installed
    - I recommend using NVM (Node Version Manager) then using that to install Node on a per project basis. The windows version can be found here: https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows
 - Run "npm install" in the terminal, this will install all of the packages needed to run the project (and all of their dependencies)

Running the application:
 - You should have completed the dev setup (install Node and all dependencies)
 - in the project directory run "npx tsc" this will compile the typescript in .\src and output to .\dist
 - run "npm start" to run the application

 Quick Guide:
  - Install Node
  - Run the following commands in the project directory:
    > npm install

    > npx tsc 
    
    > npm start
